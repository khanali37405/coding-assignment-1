<h2 style="text-align: right;"><span style=" border-style: solid; background-color: yellowgreen;">Burger</span></h2>
            <p>  “Burger” is short for “hamburger,” not because it's made of ham but because the name derived from Hamburg, Germany.
You might not think that there's anything more American than a burger.
Although the burger didn't become popular until 1904, they're a staple U.S. meal now.</p>

                <p>Beef, however, is the culinary name for meat from cattle, in the sense that beef comes from cattle apart from cows as well as the bull. Beef is reared from male and female cattle. However, the females remain heifers and are continuously breeding to produce calves for dairy and to get slaughtered for meat.</p>

            <p>Sushi is made of small pieces of raw fish that are wrapped in rice and seaweed. The seaweed, called nori, is collected with submerged bamboo nets. While some sushi is mass-produced using robots, the best sushi is made by hand. ... Wasabi and soy sauce are commonly used to flavor sushi rolls.</p>
